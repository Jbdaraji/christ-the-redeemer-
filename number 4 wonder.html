		<td style="font-size:30px;">In the mid-1850s, Pedro Maria Boss, a Vincentian priest, suggested the placement of a monument on Mount Corcovado to honor Brazilian regent Isabel, daughter of Emperor Pedro II. The suggestion was declined at the time, but the idea remained amongst the leadership of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rio de Janeiro.On November 15, 1889, the Brazilian form of government changed from a monarchy to a republic, owing to the separation of church and state.The Brazilian army used fear and censorship to erase aspects of its history from public memory and to create its own political myths. The ongoing attempts to place a statue were dismissed. In 1894, following an economic crisis, civilians took power and regained control of the government.</td>

		<td style="font-size:30px;">During the early days of the Brazilian republic in the late 1910s, the church was motivated by what they perceived as "Godlessness" in government and society. In 1920, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro organized an event called Semana do Monumento ("Monument Week") to solicit donations and petition signatures to support the building of a statue. Using these resources, the church officially proposed that a statue of Christ be built on the 704-meter Corcovado summit. The church proposed that the summit's commanding height would make it visible from anywhere in Rio, therefore declaring to all that Rio de Janeiro was a Christian city and had returned to "Godliness."</td>

<table>

		<td style="font-size:30px;">Some scholars also believe that the pitch for statue approval was that, because it could be seen from anywhere in the city, it would be a reminder to the public of their duties to God.Brazilian President Epitacio Pessoa had gained public approval as a change-maker by commissioning the construction of more than 200 dams, the University of Rio de Janeiro, the first radio station, more than 1000 km of railroads, and the implementation of a new monetary standard. In 1921, he granted permission to allow the construction of the statue on Mount Corcovado. </td>
